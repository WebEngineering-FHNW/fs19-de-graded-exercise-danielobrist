Project idea short description: 
* Kicker-Board (working title). 
* is a web application to manage teams and results from table football matches. Users can register themselves and join
one or multiple teams. Users can also create new matches and challenge other teams. A match involves always at least
two teams. Results can be submitted by the involved teams after the match (and must be approved by their opponents
to be fully valid). The web application creates leaderboards and displays the weekly/monthly/alltime champions
(individual players/teams), calculated by win-loss--differenece/goal-difference/and other data.

Other comments: 

I'm particular proud of:

- Building my first grails web application

- Writing my own actions and service methods instead of using scaffold

- Nice feedback through snackbar messages

- Deleting a team cleans up all the references it had in other domains
