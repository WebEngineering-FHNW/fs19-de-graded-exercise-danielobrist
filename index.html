    <h1>Kickerboard - Project description</h1>
    <p>
        Kickerboard is a web application to manage teams and results from table football matches.
        Users can log in and join one or multiple teams. Users can also submit new games.
        A match involves always two teams and their respective scores, which can range from 0 to 10 goals.
        The web application creates a leaderboard and dynamically displays
        the top 10 champion teams, calculated by their total number of wins and losses. A win gives 1 point, a loss deduces 1 point.
        It includes the following functionalities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Creating teams:</b> each user can create his own teams, of which he is the captain of
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Joining teams:</b> each user can join other teams. At the moment there is no limit and no confirmation
            needed
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Submitting games:</b> each user can submit games they played by selecting the winner, loser and the
            respective scores
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Confirming games:</b> after a game is submitted, it has to be confirmed by the captain of the loser team
            to be valid
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Top ten:</b> a leaderboard in the home view of the application shows the 10 best teams
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Role based security:</b> a secured access for admins is provided with an additional debug navigation menu
            item to manage the games, teams and memberships via the default grails scaffolded views
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sadly, time and resources limited the development. There are a lot of functions I wanted to implement which did
        not make it in. And the stylesheets are really messy. For accessing you can use the following credentials:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Admin access: </b>Username: Dierk, Password: toobad</li>
        <li><b>Regular User access: </b>Username: user1, Password: password1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
