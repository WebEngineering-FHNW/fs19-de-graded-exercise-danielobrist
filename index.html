    <h1>Kickerboard - Project description</h1>
    <p>
        Kickerboard is a web application to manage teams and results from table football matches.
        Users can log in and join one or multiple teams. Users can also submit new games.
        A match involves always two teams and their respective scores, which can range from 0 to 10 goals.
        The web application creates a leaderboard and dynamically displays
        the top 10 champion teams, calculated by their total number of wins and losses. A win gives 1 point, a loss deduces 1 point.
        It includes the following functionalities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Creating teams: a user can create his own team, where he is the captain of
        </li>
        <li>
            Deleting teams: the captain of a team can delete his own teams at will
        </li>
        <li>
            Joining teams: each user can join other teams. At the moment there is no limit and no confirmation needed
        </li>
        <li>
            Submitting games: each user can submit a game they played by selecting the winner, loser and the respecitve
            scores
        </li>
        <li>
            Confirming games: after a game is submitted, it has to be confirmed by the captain of the loser team to be valid
        </li>
        <li>
            Top ten: a leaderboard on the home view of the application shows the 10 best teams
        </li>
        <li>
            Role based security: a secured access for admins is provided with additional debug navigation menu item
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sadly, time and resources limited the development.
